# Switch expression
It has been revamped to act as an expression. It removes the usage of `break`.
~~~ java
switch(day) {
  case SATURDAY, SUNDAY -> System.out.println(1);
  case TUESDAY, FRIDAY -> System.out.println(2);
  case THURSDAY, MONDAY -> System.out.println(3);
  case WEDNESDAY -> System.out.println(4);
}
~~~

# Teeing collectors
Allows to collect two pieces of information from a stream pipeline.  
For example, I want to obtain `min` and `max` from an `Stream<Integer>` to create a range.
~~~ java
final List<Integer> list = Lists.of(1, 2, 5, 8);
final Range<Integer> range = list.stream()
      .collect(Collectors.teeing(
           Collectors.minBy(Integer::compareTo),
           Collectors.maxBy(Integer::compareTo),
           // custom created Range factory.
           Range::ofOptional));
~~~

# Misc.
## API Changes
* new `String.format()` method to indent and format Strings
* better error recovery in `CompletableFuture`
* new `CompactNumberFormat` to format numbers in a fashionable way
* new method `Files.mismatch(file1, file2)`, compares two files and returns the index of the first byte where they differ or `-1`

## Shenandoah
New garbage collection (GC) algorithm made for applications who prefer responsiveness and predictable short pauses.
