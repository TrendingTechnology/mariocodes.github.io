How to grant privileges for a database to a user, when both already exist.  

In this case the database name will be `project_node1`, the user `project_user` and the password `project_pass`. All the following commands have to be executed as `root` or with a user with enough privileges.  

~~~ sql
-- list system users
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

-- see current privileges
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'project_user'@'%';

-- delete all previous privileges (if needed)
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON `project_node1`.* FROM 'project_user'@'%';

-- grant new privileges and flush
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `project_node1`.* TO 'project_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
~~~
