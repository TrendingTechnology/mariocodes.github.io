_(This are my notes taken from the book Spring in Action 5th Edition)_

## Spring parts
* `Spring core` Provides the core container, dependency injection framework, Spring MVC (Rest APIs), Spring's web framework and support for template-based JDBC and reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.  
* `Spring boot` Starter dependencies and autoconfiguration.
* `Spring data` Provides the ability to define your application's data repository as Java interfaces. Works with relational (JPA), document (Mongo) and graph (Neo4j) databases.
* `Spring security` Authentication, authorization and API security.
* `Spring integration & Batch` helps integrate with other applications
* `Spring cloud` helps with microservices

## Project structure
    src/main/java
      ApplicationStarter.java

    src/test/java
      ApplicationStarterTest.java

    src/main/resources
      static
      templates
      application.properties

    mvnw.cmd
    pom.xml

* `mvnw.cmd` maven wrapper scripts. Used to build the project even without maven installed on your computer
* `static` folder to place images, stylesheets, js resources to serve to the browser
* `templates` folder to place template files that will be used to render content to the browser

## Main's config
`@SpringBootApplication` is used at the main jar's Starter as in
~~~ java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ApplicationStarter {
    // main
}
~~~

It's a composition Tag which contains another three
* `@SpringBootConfiguration` Designates the class as a configuration one. is a specialized form of `@Configuration`
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` Enables Spring to auto-configure any components that it thinks you may need
* `@ComponentScan` It lets you use another annotations such as `@Component` to declare Beans

## Web requests
The basic structure is an application which will be started with the embedded tomcat. A controller marked with `@Controller` tag and a `@GetMapping("/")` tag, which returns the name of the _Thymeleaf_ view to give to the browser.  

Controller class. It handles HTTP Requests and either gives it to a view to return HTML or writes data directly to the body (RESTful)  

~~~java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/design")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "home"; // view name
    }

}
~~~

Thymeleaf will automatically search for `/templates/home.html` and return it as the view if it exists.

### request mapping tags
* `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)` general tag prior to Spring 4.3
* `@GetMapping` handles `HTTP GET` request
* `@PostMapping` handles `HTTP POST` request
* `@PutMapping` handles ...
* `@DeleteMapping`
* `@PatchMapping`

### thymeleaf
HTML template engine.
~~~ html
<h3>Designate your wrap:<h3>
  <div th:each="ingredient: ${wrap}">
    <input name="ingredients" type="checkbox"
            th:value="${ingredient.id}" />
    <span th:text="${ingredient.name}">ING</span>
    <br/>
  </div>
~~~

### redirection
To redirect the browser to another view when the method is completely executed.
~~~ java
@PostMapping
public String processDesign(final Design design) {
  // do things
  return "redirect:/orders/current";
}
~~~

## Validation
Java's validation API works with Spring and Hibernate, this last adds a bunch of annotations to use.

### declare validation rules
This is done at the class to validate
~~~ java
@Data
public class Taco {

  @NotNull
  @Size(min=5,
        message="must be at least 5 chars long")
  private String name;

  @Size(min=1,
        message="must choose at least 1 ing")
  private List<String> ingredients;

}
~~~

~~~ java
@Data
public class Order {

  @NotBlank(message="name is required")
  private String name;

  @CreditCardNumber(message="card not valid")
  private String ccNumber;

  @Pattern(regexp="here comes the regex",
           message="must be MM/YY")
  private String ccExpiration;

  @Digits(integer=3, fraction=0,
          message="invalid CVV")
  private String ccCVV;

}
~~~

### declare validation method
This is the place where the validation will be done.
~~~ java
@PostMapping
public String process(@Valid final Taco design,
                             final Errors errors) {
  if(errors.hasErrors) {
    return "design";
  }
  // do something
  return "viewX";
}
~~~
If an error is found, the details of this error will be loaded into the `Errors` object

## Databases
### JDBC (Java DataBase Connection)
Its support is rooted at `JdbcTemplate.java`. It provides a mean for developers to perform SQL operations against a relation database without boilerplate code.

Generally it's a good idea to add an `id` field and a `createdAt` field to your beans, to know at which date and time the object was created and persisted.

**(Add link to Github where this was implemented)**
